# Dual PrusaNozzle Bowden Mount

## What is this?
This is a carriage designed to hold two Prusanozzles, encapsulating them in a forced convection environment 
powered by two 40mm DC fans. It was designed in a way that, the tip of the nozzles were only at 3 or 4 mm from
the rods, allowing my Prusa i2 to make 120 mm high parts.
To achieve this, a bowden configuration was used, so the toolhead would be light enough to go high speed.

## Why does it seem so outdated?
This is a proyect I started back in summer 2013, when I acquired two MKII prusanozzles with the intention 
of making a compact dual toolhead for my Prusa i2, capable of working with any material due to the
all-metal nature of the prusanozzle. It was made in OpenSCAD, only way of designing technical physical objects
I could use at the time.

## What happened then?
It was printed and tested, and used for a long time, but it never got to work robustly, 
with continous jams or/and uneven plastic flow, and a total imposibility to work with PLA. For all this reasons,
I never released it to the public.

## Why now?
The reasons I'm releasing this now are:
  - I learned to deal with git so far, so I want to release everything I have ever developed, and kept locked, 
    even if it works or not, just to keep a public memento of my way into the maker world.
  - There could be people out there, who spent the money the prusanozzle costs, to have a nozzle that 
    didn't work. Maybe someone could take ideas, or even use it.

## What do I do now with this?
Whatever you want. 

Fork it, use it, read it if you want a humble example of a way of working with OpenSCAD.
The Bowden tube to hotend adapter served quite good, I used it for my Budaschnozzles and works like a charm,
maybe it could be useful for you too.

The chance I'll continue this proyect is unlikely, but who knows. Anyway, the source must be free.
